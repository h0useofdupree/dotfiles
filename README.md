## Description

My multi-host dotfiles, only made possible by
[Fufexan's](https://github.com/fufexan/fufexan) hard work, smart brain and repo,
fitted to my needs and workflow. This is **not** meant to be used by anyone else
but me, although I can't stop you. If so, figure it out like me. As said, credit
goes to Mihai.

## Hosts:

- nixus (all AMD Tower)
- linx (Intel/Nvidia Laptop)

## Desktop:

- Hyprland (and Eco-System)
- HyprPanel (for now, ugh)
- Rounded monitor corners made with ags

## Editor:

- nvf (nvim for flakes)
- neovide as front-end
