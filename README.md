## Description

My multi-host dotfiles, inspired by
[Fufexan's](https://github.com/fufexan/fufexan) work. This is **not** meant to
be used by anyone else but me, although I can't stop you. If so, figure it out
like me.

## Hosts:

- nixus (all AMD Tower)
- linx (Intel/Nvidia Laptop)

## Desktop:

- Hyprland (and Eco-System)
- HyprPanel (for now, ugh)

## Editor:

- nvf (nvim for flakes)
- neovide as front-end
